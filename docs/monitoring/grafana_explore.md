# Explore Loki, Prometheus and Tempo

> Grafanaâ€™s dashboard UI is all about building dashboards for visualization. Explore strips away the dashboard and panel options so that you can focus on the query. It helps you iterate until you have a working query and then think about building a dashboard. (Grafana Labs, 2023)

## Explore Loki
